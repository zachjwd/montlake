## üí° Tips for Efficient Review

### Work in Batches
Review by category or appendix number. Don't jump around randomly.

### Start with Known Culprits
**D - Manuals** will definitely have closeout requirements (O&M manuals, warranties).
**V - Quality Assurance** will have testing/QC requirements.
**A-B - As-Built Plans** are required deliverables.

### Use Excel Filters
Filter by:
- `Priority = HIGH` to see high-priority items
- `Review_Status = Not Started` to see what's left
- `Category = D - Manuals` to focus on one category

### Document as You Go
When you find closeout requirements, immediately document in the `Closeout_Requirements_Found` column. Don't wait!

### Mark N/A Liberally
If a document is clearly just reference material with no closeout requirements, mark it `N/A` and move on. Don't waste time.

## üìà Progress Reports

## üì¶ Backing Up Your Work

The review tracker is in the Git repo, so you can commit your progress:

```bash
cd /Users/z/Desktop/git/montlake-closeout
git add appendices_review_tracker.csv
git commit -m "Appendix review progress: [describe what you reviewed]"
git push
```

This creates a backup and tracks your progress over time.
